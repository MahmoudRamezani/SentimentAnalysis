# SentimentAnalysis
In this short code, I tried to apply nltk library for a type of natural 
language processing prolem. The main problem is as follow: a set of files
including positive and negative reviews are given and we want to train a 
classifier to find if a later test review is positive or negative. To 
implement a simple solution, first the review texts are polished with off-the-shelf
functions of nltk, and then a Naive Bayes classifier is used to label the 
review as negative or positive.
